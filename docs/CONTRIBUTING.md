## Code of Conduct

This project follows a code of conduct that we expect all contributors to adhere to:

- **Be respectful**: Treat all contributors with respect and consideration
- **Be collaborative**: Work together and help each other
- **Be inclusive**: Welcome contributors of all backgrounds and skill levels
- **Be constructive**: Provide helpful feedback and be open to receiving it
- **Be patient**: Remember that everyone is learning and improving

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

1. **Development Environment**: Linux system (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended) or WSL2
2. **mise**: Polyglot tool manager and task runner ([mise.jdx.dev](https://mise.jdx.dev/))
3. **podman** (preferred) or Docker: For containerized builds
4. **Git**: Version control
5. **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with Yocto/OE, Linux, and Git

See [TOOLING.md](TOOLING.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork lamawithonel/lamadist on GitHub
   # Then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lamadist.git
   cd lamadist
   ```

2. **Add Upstream Remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/lamawithonel/lamadist.git
   git fetch upstream
   ```

3. **Install Development Tools**
   ```bash
   # mise manages all tooling — no Python, venv, or Make needed on the host
   mise install
   ```

4. **Build the Container**
   ```bash
   mise run container
   ```

5. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   # Try building for default BSP (x86_64)
   mise run build --bsp x86_64
   ```

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Always work on a feature branch, never directly on `main`:

```bash
# Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create and checkout a new feature branch
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Make focused, logical changes
- Follow Yocto/OE best practices (see below)
- Test your changes locally
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add <files>

# Commit with a descriptive message (scope is strongly encouraged)
git commit -m "feat(recipe): add custom monitoring service

Add a new systemd service that monitors system health.

Ticket: LAMA-42
See: https://example.com/monitoring-design"
```

See [Commit Message Standards](#commit-message-standards) below.

### 4. Keep Your Branch Updated

```bash
# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Rebase your branch on upstream/main
git rebase upstream/main

# Or merge if rebasing is problematic
git merge upstream/main
```

### 5. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

### 6. Open a Pull Request

- Go to the GitHub repository
- Click "New Pull Request"
- Select your fork and branch
- Fill out the PR template (see [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md))
- Link any related issues

---

## Branching Strategy (JIT Flow)

LamaDist uses **JIT Flow** — a lightweight branching strategy built around Conventional Commit type prefixes and linear history on `main`.

### Feature Branches

Feature branches branch off `main` using the pattern:

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

Where `<type>` is any [Conventional Commit](#commit-message-standards) type prefix:

- `feat/` — New features or enhancements
- `fix/` — Bug fixes
- `docs/` — Documentation changes
- `refactor/` — Code refactoring
- `test/` — Adding or updating tests
- `chore/` — Maintenance tasks, build changes
- `ci/` — CI/CD changes
- `build/` — Build system changes
- `perf/` — Performance improvements
- `security/` — Security fixes or improvements

Feature branches merge back into `main` via Pull Request.

### Releases and Tags

- **Tags on `main`** create releases
- **Latest stable version** = latest tag on `main`
- **Latest unstable** = HEAD of `main`

### Breaking Changes and Release Branches

When a **breaking change** is introduced on `main`, the commit **prior** to the breaking change is forked into a new release branch:

```
release/<major>[.minor][-codename]
```

- Non-breaking changes may be backported to `release/` branches
- Prefer `release/<major>.<minor>` format for branches receiving only important fix backports
- Subsequent releases for a `release/` branch are tagged on that branch

### JIT Flow Diagram

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "..."
    branch "feat/add-k3s"
    checkout "feat/add-k3s"
    commit id: "feat commit"
    checkout main
    merge "feat/add-k3s"
    commit id: "v1.0.0" tag: "v1.0.0"
    branch "release/1.x"
    checkout main
    commit id: "breaking!" type: HIGHLIGHT
    commit id: "v2.0.0" tag: "v2.0.0"
    checkout "release/1.x"
    commit id: "backported fix"
    commit id: "v1.0.1" tag: "v1.0.1"
```

### Branch Naming Examples

```
feat/add-k3s-support
fix/systemd-boot-timeout
docs/update-architecture
refactor/kas-config-structure
test/add-image-boot-tests
chore/update-dependencies
ci/add-build-matrix
build/migrate-to-mise
perf/optimize-sstate-cache
security/patch-cve-2024-1234
```

### Branch Naming Guidelines

- Use lowercase letters
- Use hyphens to separate words (not underscores or spaces)
- Keep names concise but descriptive
- Include issue number if applicable: `fix/123-boot-failure`

---

## Commit Message Standards

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. The `[optional scope]` is **strongly encouraged**.

### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s) / git trailers]
```

## Yocto/OE Best Practices

### Recipe Writing

1. **Use SPDX License Identifiers**
   ```bitbake
   # SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   ```

2. **Include Clear License Information**
   ```bitbake
   LICENSE = "MIT"
   LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://LICENSE;md5=..."
   ```

3. **Use Appropriate Recipe Style**
   ```bitbake
   SUMMARY = "Brief one-line description"
   DESCRIPTION = "Longer, more detailed description of the package"
   HOMEPAGE = "https://project.homepage.com"
   SECTION = "devel"
   ```

4. **Proper Variable Ordering**
   - License information first
   - SRC_URI and checksums
   - Dependencies (DEPENDS, RDEPENDS)
   - Build configuration (inherit, EXTRA_OECONF, etc.)
   - Install tasks
   - Package configuration

5. **Use bbappends Appropriately**
   - Place in your layer, not upstream layers
   - Keep minimal and focused
   - Document why the append is needed

### KAS Configuration

1. **Keep configs modular**: Base configs + BSP overlays + feature overlays
2. **Document overrides**: Comment complex configurations
3. **Pin versions**: Specify branches/tags for reproducibility
4. **Use proper YAML syntax**: Valid YAML with clear structure

### Layer Management

1. **Layer dependencies**: Declare all dependencies in `layer.conf`
2. **Layer priority**: Set appropriate `BBFILE_PRIORITY`
3. **Layer compatibility**: Update `LAYERSERIES_COMPAT` for each release
4. **Layer README**: Maintain comprehensive layer documentation
